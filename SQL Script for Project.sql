Consider all users that purchased a subscription plan for the first time between January 1 and March 31, 2023 (inclusive).
Consider all their page interactions before their purchase date.
Remove test users (ones that paid 0 dollars).
Create aliases (nicknames) for the URLs.
Combine all the pages of each session into a single user journey string.
Export all this data as a CSV with the user_id, session_id, subscription_type, and user journey */



/* Filtering User Data and Fetching First Purchase Dates
Explanation: In this step, we filter users who made their first purchase between January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023, 
and exclude those who paid 0 dollars (test users). We also determine the type of subscription they purchased (Monthly, Quarterly, or Annual). */

/*Combine all the pages of each session into a single user journey string
In Task 4, we need to combine all the URLs (or their aliases) of each session into a single string, where each page visited will be concatenated in the order the user visited them. This will create a "user journey" string for each session.

Steps:
Concatenate the URLs: For each session, we will combine all the URLs visited (source and destination URLs).
Group by Session: We will group the results by session_id, so each session will have one combined user journey.
Handle Long Journeys: We need to handle the case where the journey string might be too long. We'll use GROUP_CONCAT() to aggregate the URLs, and we'll adjust its length limit to ensure that it doesnâ€™t get truncated.
Order the pages: Ensure that the pages are ordered by event_date so the user journey reflects the correct sequence of visits. */
